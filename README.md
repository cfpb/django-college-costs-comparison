The school search API

The search results include the URL for more data on each school:

    [
    [
    "Harrisburg Area Community College-Harrisburg",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/212878.json"
    ],
    [
    "ITT Technical Institute-Harrisburg",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/430351.json"
    ],
    [
    "Kaplan Career Institute-Harrisburg",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/251075.json"
    ],
    [
    "Empire Beauty School-Harrisburg",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/212382.json"
    ],
    [
    "Widener University-Harrisburg Campus",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/402828.json"
    ],
    [
    "Harrisburg University of Science and Technology",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/446640.json"
    ],
    [
    "Pennsylvania State University-Penn State Harrisburg",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/214713.json"
    ],
    [
    "University of Phoenix-Harrisburg Campus",
    "/comparisontool/api/school/448831.json"
    ]
    ]

The school detail json files are simply a dictionary of keys from the
CSV.

The BAH Lookup API
==================

As simple as could be:

/comparisontool/api/bah-lookup.json?zip5=17033

If the zip code is found, it returns a dictionary with a single 'rate'
member representing the BAH rate.

If the zip code was not found, it returns an empty dictionary.

The worksheet API
=================

*api/worksheet*

Accepts an otherwise-empyt post request, responds with a JSON dictionary
that includes a WORKSHEET ID.

*api/worksheet/WORKSHEET ID.json*

Accepts only POST requests.

Returns the current saved worksheet as JSON

If you include data in your POST request, it will be saved (and
reflected back to you in the response)

The email API
=============

*api/email*

Accepts post requests with two parameters: 'id' and 'email'.

'id' is a WORKSHEET ID

'email' is the recipients email.

example\_project.settings is now configured to use the "console"
backend, as described here:
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/#console-backend>
